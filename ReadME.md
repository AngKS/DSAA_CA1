# Project Title
ST1507 Data Structures & Algorithms(AI) CA1 Assignment

This is my CA1 assignment to implement a Morse code encoder/decoder and analyser.
## Getting Started
You can run this project using the following command:

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AngKS/DSAA_CA1.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd <project directory>
   ```
3. Run the program
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

The program has 3 main functions:
1. Encoding a message
   - The program is able to encode an input message into its Morse code equivalent
2. Decoding a message
   - The program is able to decode a string of morse code into its original message
3. Message Analysis
   - Given an input text file of morse code and an output source file; the program is able to correctly decode the morse code
   - Analyse the occurence of each word (frequency and the exact positions of each word)
   - Form a string of "ESSENTIAL" message to "summarize" the entire string of message
   - Form an analysis report and write the analyis into the output text file provided.
